= Task: Order Processing API

== Description
Prepare a dedicated REST API for handling order processing.

== Objectives

    Design and Implement RESTful Endpoints: Create well-defined API endpoints for managing orders within the e-commerce system.
    Ensure Robust Error Handling: Utilize a global exception handler to manage errors across the order processing module.
    Develop Comprehensive Unit and Integration Tests: Achieve a minimum of 85% coverage for service layer tests and ensure all endpoints are tested.
    Secure API Access: Implement JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization to secure endpoints.

== Architectural Layers
=== Controller Layer
Handle HTTP requests and responses specific to order management.
Define endpoints with appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

=== Service Layer
Encapsulate the business logic for order processing (create, update, retrieve, delete).
Communicate with the repository layer to perform data access and manipulation.

=== Repository Layer
Interface with the database to execute CRUD operations on order data.

== Endpoint Specifications

    Create Order

    Type: POST
    Payload: Order details
    Actions: Validate input, create an order in the database, return order details with a 201 status code.

    Get Order by ID

    Type: GET
    Actions: Retrieve order details based on the order ID.

    Delete Order

    Type: DELETE
    Actions: Verify order existence, remove the order from the database.

== Validation Standards
Use annotations like @Valid, @NotNull for method parameters in controllers to enforce validation rules.
Implement custom validators if required for business-specific validation rules.
