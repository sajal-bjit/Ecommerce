= Task: Create search API for the categorize & search product section

== Actions

    An entity for a product is already added to the context. Your task is to create an API to search for a product by either its ID or name (full/partial match), as more than one product can have the same name.
    ** /api/v1/find/{productId}
    ** /api/v1/find/{productName}

In the repository package, create/modify a repository for the product table and add necessary methods for the above-mentioned API.

In the exception handler, create a global exception handler and create custom exceptions if needed.

Use the provided DTO for every response.

The necessary business logic will be in the service layer (e.g., service package). Use interface and its implementation.

== Guidelines

    Follow the best coding guidelines that were given before via parent prompt.
    Code should be clean, refactored, and with JavaDoc.
    Provide comments for important logics.
