Child Prompt : User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control System
 
## Overview
 
Develop a robust user authentication system using Spring Security that supports login, registration, and role-based access control (RBAC). This system adheres to the specified coding standards and includes several components focused on security, efficiency, and maintainability.

## System Components
 
### Repository Layer
 
- **Design Interfaces**: 
  - Create repository interfaces to manage user data efficiently.
  - Ensure efficient retrieval and storage of user credentials and roles.
 
- **Query Methods**:
  - Implement methods for finding users by username.
  - Verify existing roles effectively.
 
### Service Layer
 
- **Authentication Logic**:
  - Utilize Spring Security for secure authentication mechanisms.
 
- **Registration Services**:
  - Handle user registration with secure password hashing using BCrypt.
  - Ensure input validation aligns with bean validation standards.
 
### Controller Layer
 
- **Endpoint Creation**:
  - Define RESTful endpoints for user login, registration, and account management features like password reset and account update.
 
- **Request Handling**:
  - Securely handle requests/responses.
  - Ensure appropriate HTTP status codes are returned for success and failure scenarios.
 
### Security Configuration
 
- **Spring Security Setup**:
  - Configure Spring Security for managing user sessions and protecting resources.
  - Effectively enforce RBAC.
 
- **Access Restrictions**:
  - Define security policies to restrict endpoint access based on user roles.
 
### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
 
- **Role Definitions**:
  - Establish distinct roles such as Admin, User, and Guest using enums, each with specific permissions and access levels.
 
- **RBAC Logic**:
  - Implement logic ensuring actions comply with assigned user roles.
 
#### Example Role Enum:
 
```java
public enum Role {
    ADMIN, USER, GUEST;
}
```
 
#### Security Configuration Example
 
 
## Deliverables
 
1. **Source Code**:
   - Fully documented code for repository interfaces, service implementations, and controller endpoints.
 
2. **Configuration Files**:
   - Complete Spring Security configuration files.
 
3. **Unit and Integration Tests**:
   - Comprehensive test suite with at least 85% coverage for the service layer.
   - Validate both functionality and security measures.
