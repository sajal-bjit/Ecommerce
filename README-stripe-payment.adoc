Child Prompt: Stripe Payment Gateway Integration
 
PROMPT OVERVIEW
 
Integrate the Stripe payment gateway into your existing Spring Boot application by implementing backend functionalities to handle payment processing.
Implementing secure payment processing using the Stripe SDK.
Ensuring compliance with PCI DSS standards.
Maintaining separation of concerns by structuring code within the appropriate layers.
 
1. Stripe SDK Integration:
- Integrate the latest version of the Stripe Java SDK into the Spring Boot application via Maven dependencies.
2. Configuration:
- Securely configure your Stripe secret key in application.properties.
- Ensure environment-specific configurations to separate development and production credentials.
 
3. Service Layer:
- Develop a PaymentService class responsible for handling all payment-related operations.
- The service should include methods for creating payment intents, capturing payments, and handling refunds.
 
@Service
public class PaymentService {
 
    // Method to create a payment intent
    public PaymentIntent createPaymentIntent(Order order) {
        // Logic to integrate with Stripe and create a payment intent
    }
 
    // Method to capture payment
    public Payment capturePayment(String paymentIntentId) {
        // Logic to capture payment using Stripe
    }
 
    // Method to process refunds
    public Refund processRefund(Long orderId) {
        // Logic to initiate a refund via Stripe
    }
}
 
4. Controller Layer:
- Define RESTful endpoints in a PaymentController that handle HTTP requests related to payment operations, utilizing the PaymentService.
- Ensure proper HTTP methods and clear endpoint mappings.
 
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/payments")
public class PaymentController {
 
    @Autowired
    private PaymentService paymentService;
 
    @PostMapping("/create-intent")
    public ResponseEntity<PaymentIntent> createPaymentIntent(@RequestBody Order order) {
        // Call PaymentService to create a payment intent
    }
 
    @PostMapping("/capture/{paymentIntentId}")
    public ResponseEntity<Payment> capturePayment(@PathVariable String paymentIntentId) {
        // Call PaymentService to capture payment
    }
 
    @PostMapping("/refund/{orderId}")
    public ResponseEntity<Refund> processRefund(@PathVariable Long orderId) {
        // Call PaymentService to process refund
    }
}
 
5. Security Considerations
 
- Use secure protocols and methods to ensure sensitive data is handled safely.
- Validate inputs rigorously to prevent security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
 
6. Testing Requirements
 
- Write unit tests for the PaymentService to ensure payment processing logic is correct.
- Conduct integration testing to verify end-to-end functionality of payment operations.
 
7. Error Handling
 
- Implement robust error handling within the PaymentService to manage any exceptions from the Stripe SDK.
- Utilize the global exception handler pattern to provide meaningful error responses to clients.
 
8. Logging and Auditing
 
- Implement audit logging for all payment-related activities to maintain a record of transactions.
- Ensure logs include details such as user actions, transaction IDs, timestamps, and status.
 
9. Documentation
 
- Provide comprehensive Javadoc comments for all methods and classes related to payment processing.
- Update README with setup instructions for Stripe integration and usage guidelines.
 
10. Expected Deliverables:
- Updated pom.xml with Stripe dependency.
- Configuration files with Stripe settings.
- PaymentService class with implemented methods for handling Stripe payments.
- Controller class with endpoints for initiating and confirming payments.
- Test cases covering the payment process and error scenarios.
